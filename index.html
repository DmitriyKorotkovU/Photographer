  <p>In the picture we can see a fisher and a beautiful picturesque landscape: a lake and a forest. It’s autumn, many of the trees are already yellow. Their leaves started to fall down.

    The thick forest occupies all the banks of the lake. It seems to be a mixedforest. It consists of broad-leaved trees as well as conifers. If you look farther, you can see a misty line of mountains on the horizon.
    
    Most probably, this picture was taken somewhere in the middle latitudes – the USA or Canada, – in some remote and uninhabited place. People come hereto spend time far from cities and enjoy the nature. The nature is truly delightful here.
    
    It’s a sunny day, the sky is high and blue. It is reflected in the clear azure water. The lake is vast and deep, one can sail in the boat in it. The temperature is too low to swim, but it’s certainly a nice day for fishing.
    
    In the middle of the picture, there is a man with a fishing rod. He is standing on a sunlit rock. He is wearing loose simple clothes: a blue T-shirt, a beige waistcoat, big white shorts and sport shoes.
    
    His hair is short, brown and curly. His hands are raised to hold the fishing rod and it looks like he is going to pull it out and check if he has anything there.</p>
